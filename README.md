=================

Dockerfiles and assets for building Docker containers 

FORKED FROM MESOSPHERE
=================
This is simply the state of the mesosphere repository *before* they deleted the source code (Dockerfile) for creating spark containers.
It is a handy reference to what was happening but should not be used for anything.
Mesosphere have stated that they will open source the up-to-date information for creating their Spark containers soon.
